In an era when markets are becoming increasingly saturated and the competition between businesses continue to intensify, customer churn presents a real problem. It has become apparent to business owners that for their companies to compete favourably, there is a need to implement carefully thought-out customer retention strategies that seek to initiate, maintain, and strengthen long-lasting relationships with customers (Torkzadeh, Chang, & Hansen, 2006).This is especially applicable in highly competitive, subscription-based service industries such as the telecommunication industry.
Customer retention is very important and remains the topmost priority of
companies and while there are indeed many reasons for this, the following
reasons are worth noting:
1. Cost of getting new customers: In 2000, a report published by management
consultancy firm, Bain and Company estimated that the cost of acquiring
a new customer is 7 times that of retaining an existing customer (Baveja,
n.d.). The monetary impact of customer churn is even more pronounced when
the following statistic is considered: according to the 2020 CallMiner Churn
Index report, US companies lost $136.8 billion per year due to consumers
making switches that could have been prevented (CallMiner, 2020). 
2. Social network influence
Long term customers tend to refer more people to the company; conversely,
churned customers also tend to influence other customers within their social
network to leave. This observation was formally made in analyses carried out
by (Nitzan & Libai, 2011) which found that exposure of an existing customer
to a defecting social network “neighbour” increases their risk of also defecting
by up to 80%. Furthermore, this value was found to increase significantly
with increasing social network size and/or decrease with increasing customer
loyalty.
3. Long term customers are more beneficial
Companies benefit more from long term customers in terms of increased sales
and reduced costs. Long term customers, who have developed an increased
trust in a company, tend to spend more by acquiring and utilising more goods
and services from that company (Burez & Van den Poel, 2009; De Caigny,
Coussement, & De Bock, 2018; Thoumy & Abdallah, 2017). Conversely,
newer customers with less developed trust tend to spend less as they are
generally sceptical about the value of goods or services offered by the company.
It is also important to recognise that long term customers tend to have
their behaviours, needs and preferences better accommodated due to the
company’s ability to analyse and understand these traits over longer time
frames than newer customers. Furthermore, a significant amount of time,
energy, and resources needs to be expended by the company when initially
gathering the data of newer customers to be able to tailor future experiences
appropriately (De Caigny et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2012).
4. Competition has less effect on loyal customers
Lastly, as customers stay committed to a particularly company for longer,
marketing strategies of competing businesses tend to have less effect on them
